# Capstone Project (Online shop)

> This is my Capstone Project for the Ruby module of the Microverse course.
In this project, I was required to create a parser from any website available on the internet.
The choosen website was cagometro.com, a website dedicated to count the worst-mistakes (popularly called "cagadas" or, in english, "shits") done by Brazil's actual President Jair Bolsonaro.
Unfortunately, the lack of records after April 2020 surely means that the website is no longer being updated.
